Please note: For this code to work, you need getpass module. To get it, install it by typing "pip install getpass" in the command prompt.

Also note, if you want this password method to work, then you need to convert it to exe using pyinstaller. Install it by pip install pyinstaller in your
command prompt. Then type - pyinstaller "yourfile.py". It will take some time. You will find your exe in a folder named "dist".

while True:
    speak.Speak("Please Enter the password to access JARVIS the virtual assistant - ")    
    password = getpass.getpass("Please Enter the password to access JARVIS the virtual assistant - ")

    if password == "yourpassword":
        speak.Speak("ACCESS GRANTED")
        print('\n')
        print("ACCESS GRANTED")
        print('\n')

        break

    else:
        speak.Speak("Access Denied")
        print('\n')
        print("ACCESS DENIED")
        print('\n')
